## Final Web Dev Project (Aug.-Dec. 2017)
by tianders295

### Original Documentation
Note:

- Entering "C0001" as the customer ID on login will load results on every page. 
  Other customer IDs work, but they might not have records associated with them in other tables.
  Any password works.

- The index.html file in the PHP half redirects to the index.html in the Java half upon loading

- Per the documentation, there are no "database" files; all the SQL needed is in the dbQueries folder.

### New Documentation (Sept. 2018)
This was built for my old Web Dev class in late 2017. 
The specs were to make a website for booking a hotel, complete with an SQL database.
Some of the code in here is very janky and buggy; I have no idea how I aced this, personally.

This is only here to attest to the fact that, through blood, sweat and tears, I did it. Maybe someday I'll go back and fix this.

This can be all installed in one place, and then run using a PHP and a Java server (per the spec; it was an introductory web dev course).
